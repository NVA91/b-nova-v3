# Legacy file retained for compatibility.
# Host hardware/platform settings are now defined via Single Source of Truth:
# - inventory/production/hosts.yml loads hardware_profile from inventory/hardware/pve01.yml
# - site.yml maps hardware_profile.proxmox.* into legacy variables (zfs_enabled, storages, ...)
